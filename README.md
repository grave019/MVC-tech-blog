  ## Goals

  To utilize deployment of heroku with SQL an application that can save login information as well as inputs as a tech blog.

  ## Usage

  A tech blog wear people can register and input entries onto the site.

  ## Installation
  
  npm start also make sure you are connected to local server and that has your database created.

  ## Test

  no test are needed for the application

  ## Problems

  The most difficulty I had was deploying the page to heroku. I learned that changing lower case to an uppercase in github does not recognize the change right away because github does not recognize changes from uppercase to lowercase."
